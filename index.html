<h1>Notes from Lesson 1 (Introduction to Programming Nanodegree)</h1>

<b>What is HTML?</b>
<p>Before a person can even begin writing his/her webpage, he/she will first
have to be conversant in the language spoken by the computer. 

HTML (Hypertext Mark-up Language) is the language used 
to write webpages on the internet.  In other words, the person will need to know 
what are the commands <em> (or tag) </em> that can be given to a computer. 
Most tags begin with an opening < tag > and end with a closing < /tag >. However, there are some tags 
that do not need a closing tag and this is known as a void tag. 

Everything that falls within a tag (including the tag itself) is known 
as an "element". Together, all of the "elements" in a HTML document will come together to give a webpage
its structure and content.<br><br>

It is unnecessary to memorise all the tags because:
a) there are probably too many tags to be remembered, and b) one can just
google for them.
</p>

<b> Examples of tags taught in the lesson </b> 

<p> i) To bold a word, one uses the tag < b > < /b> .<br> 
    ii) To italicise a word, one uses the tag < em > < /em>. <br>
    iii) To insert a link, one uses the tag < a href= </a>"url">
    <em> title of the link </em> < /a >". <br>
    iv) To insert an image, one uses the tag < img svc = "url" alt="text"> <br>
    v) To insert a break in between the lines, one uses the tag < br >
</p>

<b>Differentiating between Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>Block elements create an invisible box separating the text that 
falls within the "element" and those without. Inline elements on the other hand
do not have that effect of separating the text.
